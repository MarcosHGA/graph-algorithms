# graph-algorithms

## What is it?
Graph algoritms consist in measure or find something in a graph. In our case, we are looking to find the shortest path in a given graph.
Also, we generate a graph based on coordinates of cities calculating its euclidean distance.

## What's the point?
The aim of this study is to analyse the four main algorithms to find the shortest path in a graph.
